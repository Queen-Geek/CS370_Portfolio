In this project, I worked extensively on implementing and refining a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a maze pathfinding problem using an intelligent agent. The initial code I was given included some basic structure and helper functions within the TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py files. However, these files lacked the complete implementation needed for the intelligent agent to learn and navigate the maze effectively.

The core task involved creating the deep Q-learning algorithm, which required defining a Q-network using neural networks in PyTorch. I wrote the code to set up this Q-network, including the layers, activation functions, and the forward pass method. Additionally, I implemented the main training loop where the agent learns by exploring the maze, taking actions, and receiving rewards or penalties. This involved using an epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation, storing experiences in a replay memory, and training the neural network with these experiences.

The work also included debugging and ensuring the code ran without errors. This involved addressing various issues related to tensor dimensions, function definitions, and logic errors. By the end, the code was able to successfully train an intelligent agent to navigate the maze and find the treasure, demonstrating the application of reinforcement learning techniques.

Connecting this learning to the larger field of computer science, it becomes clear how fundamental concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and machine learning play a crucial role in developing intelligent systems. Computer scientists are tasked with designing and implementing these systems to solve real-world problems, ranging from simple pathfinding in mazes to more complex applications like autonomous driving and natural language processing. The work they do is vital as it drives innovation, improves efficiency, and can significantly impact various industries and aspects of daily life.

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves a methodical and analytical mindset. It starts with understanding the problem requirements and constraints, followed by designing an algorithm or model that can address these needs. This often involves breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, using mathematical and logical reasoning, and leveraging existing knowledge and tools. Debugging and iterative testing are also critical components, as they help refine the solution and ensure it works as intended.

Ethical responsibilities are paramount in the field of computer science. To the end user, my responsibilities include ensuring the software is reliable, safe, and respects user privacy. Itâ€™s important to avoid biases in algorithms, particularly in machine learning models, to ensure fair and equitable outcomes. Transparency in how data is used and how decisions are made by the software is also crucial. To the organization, my responsibilities involve delivering high-quality, maintainable code, protecting intellectual property, and adhering to legal and ethical standards. Balancing innovation with ethical considerations ensures that technological advancements benefit society as a whole while minimizing potential harms.

Overall, this project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical concepts from the course, reinforcing the importance of a structured approach to problem-solving and the ethical implications of our work in computer science.
